## Hi — I’m Yash Dubey 👋  

I’m an aspiring **Data Analyst** who enjoys working with real-world data to understand how businesses operate, how performance changes over time, and how decisions are made using numbers. My experience comes primarily from hands-on projects where I’ve taken data from raw, messy formats and turned it into clear, decision-ready insights.

I work end to end across the analytics workflow, from data preparation and validation to analysis, visualization, and insight communication. My projects span business, finance, retail, and transaction-level analytics, with a consistent focus on accuracy, structure, and clarity rather than just visuals.

This GitHub serves as my analytics portfolio, showcasing practical projects that reflect how data is used in real business contexts to track performance, identify patterns, and support informed decision-making.
